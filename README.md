# Ionic 4 + Express + MySQL

This project is a mobile application that allows an admin, once authenticated, to collect and submit onsite user data.
An example of this would be a kiosk mounted tablet that collects a user's agreement that they read a legal notice.  
An admin user must first register and log in, then the application is ready to collect the input data.  

### Project Structure
